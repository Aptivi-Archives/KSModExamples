# KS Mod Examples

This repository is the constantly-growing pack of mods that you can use as examples. It will adapt to the current version of KS released on NuGet.

To check them out, build the solution yourself using Microsoft Visual Studio or the way you like. They'll be automatically installed to your KSMods directory on your home folder.

Select the version in the branch appropriate to your version series of KS, like if you're going to use these examples in the 0.0.16.x series, choose the `0.0.16.x` branch.
